This is a semi-curated collection of Master and PhD programs in Robotics and Machine Learning. I am only including programs that are taught in English, as this is aimed for international applicants. I  focus on programs outside of North America, as there is plenty of information about them and they are saturated in terms of applicants. Countries in this list generally provide better visa policies than what you usually get in North America.

# Europe

## Germany

 1.- University of Freiburg - [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.tf.uni-freiburg.de/en/study-programs/computer-science/m-sc-computer-science)
    Masters in CS with multiple courses in AI/ML/Robotics, but for non-EU students it costs 1500 € + matriculation fee per semester.

 2.- University of Bonn - [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en/for-students/master-of-science-in-computer-science) 
    Masters in CS with multiple courses in ML/Robotics, with several labs doing research in both disciplines. Costs only matriculation fees (290 €) per semester for all nationalities.

 3.- TU Munich - [Master of Science in Informatics](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/informatics/) and [Master of Science in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/robotics-cognition-intelligence-msc/) Both Masters in the Computer Science Department, with many electives in all fields of AI and Robotics, and many labs doing state of the art research such as the Computer Vision Group. Costs are only matriculation fees (140 €) per semester for all nationalities.

 4.- Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences - [Master of Science in Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) A Masters in Robotics in a Computer Science Department at a University of Applied Sciences, which is more applied than a regular University, I finished this program and it is more research oriented. Courses can be taken at other local Universities, and costs are low at only matriculation fees per (250 €) semester.

 5.- University of Tübingen - [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/studies/studies-programs/machine-learning/) A new Masters focusing in Machine Learning. This University has lots of connections with neighboring institutes like the MPI for Intelligent Systems, making it a good choice for networking. Costs are 1500 € per semester.

## Switzerland

 1.- EPFL - [Master of Science in Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) A master program specifically in Robotics, in English with some French electives. Cost around 700 CHF per semester.
