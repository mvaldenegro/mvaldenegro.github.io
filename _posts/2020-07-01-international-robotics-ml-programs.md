This is a semi-curated collection of Master and PhD programs in Robotics and Machine Learning. I am only including programs that are taught in English, as this is aimed for international applicants. I  focus on programs outside of North America, as there is plenty of information about them and they are saturated in terms of applicants. Countries in this list generally provide better visa policies than what you usually get in North America.

**Disclaimer** This is only a collection of information, there is no guarantee that it is correct, as requirements or fees might have changed over time. Please always check the links in each program for the latest official information.
