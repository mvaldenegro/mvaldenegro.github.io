This is a semi-curated collection of Master and PhD programs in Robotics and Machine Learning. I am only including programs that are taught in English, as this is aimed for international applicants. I  focus on programs outside of North America, as there is plenty of information about them and they are saturated in terms of applicants. Countries in this list generally provide better visa policies than what you usually get in North America.

**Disclaimer** This is only a collection of information, there is no guarantee that it is correct, as requirements or fees might have changed over time. Please always check the links in each program for the latest official information.

# Europe

## France

 1.- École Centrale de Nantes - [Masters in Advanced Robotics](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/masters/advanced-robotics-coro-imaro) and [Masters in Signal and Image Processing](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/masters/signal-and-image-processing-coro-sip) Masters programs in Robotics and Computer Vision, with possibilities for academic exchange with partner Universities. Costs for non-EU students are 15000 € for the complete program, and there are scholarships available.

 2.- University of Burgundy - [Master of Science in Computer Vision](https://www.vibot.org/msc-in-computer-vision.html) A two year program in Computer Vision and Robotics, with possibilities for academic exchange with partner Universities. Costs 1500 € per year.

## Germany

 1.- University of Freiburg - [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.tf.uni-freiburg.de/en/study-programs/computer-science/m-sc-computer-science)
    Masters in CS with multiple courses in AI/ML/Robotics, but for non-EU students it costs 1500 € + matriculation fee per semester.

 2.- University of Bonn - [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/en/for-students/master-of-science-in-computer-science) 
    Masters in CS with multiple courses in ML/Robotics, with several labs doing research in both disciplines. Costs only matriculation fees (290 €) per semester for all nationalities.

 3.- TU Munich - [Master of Science in Informatics](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/informatics/) and [Master of Science in Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/robotics-cognition-intelligence-msc/) Both Masters in the Computer Science Department, with many electives in all fields of AI and Robotics, and many labs doing state of the art research such as the Computer Vision Group. Costs are only matriculation fees (140 €) per semester for all nationalities. Note that the Master in Robotics requires some German knowledge, while the Master in Informatics can be completed entirely in English.

 4.- Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences - [Master of Science in Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) A Masters in Robotics in a Computer Science Department at a University of Applied Sciences, which is more applied than a regular University, I finished this program and it is more research oriented. Courses can be taken at other local Universities, and costs are low at only matriculation fees (250 €) per semester.

 5.- University of Tübingen - [Master of Science in Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/studies/studies-programs/machine-learning/) A new Masters focusing in Machine Learning. This University has lots of connections with neighboring institutes like the MPI for Intelligent Systems, making it a good choice for networking. Costs are 1500 € per semester.

## Switzerland

 1.- EPFL - [Master of Science in Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) A master program specifically in Robotics, in English with some French electives. Cost around 700 CHF per semester.

 2.- ETH Zurich - [Master in Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-cs-2020.html) and [Master in Robotics, Systems, and Control](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/master/master-rsc.html) Both programs cover Machine Learning, Robotics, and Computer Vision at a top University, with many labs doing research in these fields. Costs are around 700 CHF per semester.

## Spain

 1.- University of Barcelona - [Masters in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-artificial-intelligence) This is a joint master program in AI/ML/CV with the Polytechnic University of Catalonia and Rovira i Virgili University, which gives access to a wider selection of courses than a standard program. Costs are 2500 - 3300 € in total during 3 semesters, around 1100 € per semester.

 2.- Autonomous University of Barcelona - [Masters in Computer Vision](https://pagines.uab.cat/mcv/) Another joint master program in ML/CV with the Open University of Catalonia, Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and Pompeu Fabra University. It combines classroom and distance learning, and has ties with the Computer Vision Center of the UAB. Costs are between 2600 - 4500 € for the whole program.

## Multiple Countries

 1.- [Japan-Europe Masters on Advanced Robotics](https://jemaro.ec-nantes.fr/) A joint Erasmus Mundus Master on Robotics, in collaboration with three European and one Japanese Universities. The first year is spent in Europe, while the second year and Master Thesis is done in Japan. The complete program costs 18000 € for non-EU students, but there are scholarships available. Two Master's degrees are awarded at the end.
