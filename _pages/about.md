I am a researcher at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de), [Robotics Innovation Center](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de) in Bremen, Germany.

I am interested in making robots be able to "see" and perceive just as us humans do. My research interests are in Deep Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Robot Vision, and Underwater Robotics.

I regularly teach courses at the [University of Bremen](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/) and teach and supervise Master Students at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg's [Master of Autonomous Systems Program](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems).

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University, a Master of Science in Autonomous Systems from [Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg](https://www.h-brs.de), and an Engineering Degree from [Universidad Tecnologica Metropolitana](http://www.utem.cl).

My [PhD Thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05241) deals with the problem of detecting submerged marine debris in sonar images using neural networks. I have the strong belief that we should not be polluting our oceans and bodies of water, as it is a vital element for our survival.
